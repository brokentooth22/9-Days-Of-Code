Leetcode 1752 Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated
Easy but tricky question, was required to see the solution
trick lies with checking if more than one element are in unsorted manner and the last element is bigger than the first element-
then it is false(not possible) otherwise true
Code- T.C- O(n), S.C- O(1)

class Solution {
    public boolean check(int[] nums) {
        int count=0;
        int n=nums.length;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++)
        {
            if(nums[i]>nums[(i+1)%n])  //this modof n is for checking the last element is greater than first element if yes then it is false
                count++;
        }
        if(count>1)return false;
        else return true;
    }
    
   
}
